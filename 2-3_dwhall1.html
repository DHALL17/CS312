        <p>
            I began working on <em>my portfolio website</em> using github pages to host it.
            Since <strong>the portfolio website</strong> will host links to other websites/projects a simple html, css, and javascript website was enough.
            I plan to design more websites to place on the website.
            <em><strong>I will hopefully be able to use the website as a way for companies to see my work.</strong></em>
