        <p>
            I woke up and went to work like any other day except <span id="awesome">this day was different</span>.
            I realized I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oo8QzDHimQ">no longer had to go to class</a> and do mundane, boring tasks to appease teachers.
            Being able to work without the bothering of classes and there "expectations" greatly relieved me.
